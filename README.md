1: Introduction

Welcome to Adventure. In the coming hours, you will embark on a mysterious journey to escape the mysterious
landscape that you have inexplicably walked into with your friend. The best tool you have with you is the power of exploration.
In order to ultimately escape, you will have to explore your surroundings, encountering a variety of items along
the way. 

2: Interacting with the world

NOTE: Commands are NOT case sensitive.

LOOK
There are many ways you can interact with the world around you. One of the first things you may want to do is 
get a better idea of what is around you. To do this, you can use the look command. This will return a description
of the room you are in, as well as the possible directions you can move, and any items in the room at the time.
To execute this command, simply type "look" into the console when given the opportunity.

LOOK @ OBJECT
You can also look at objects, along with rooms. To look at an object, type "look" followed by the name of the 
object you want to look at. It is IMPORTANT TO NOTE that you can only look at objects in your inventory. When 
this command is executed, you will be given the name of the object, as well as a short description for it. 

MOVE
The next thing you will have to do to escape is move. Moving is quite simple. You must be aware that you are 
allowed to move in the direction you desire from the room you are currently in. This information can be found 
by looking at the room (SEE LOOK). To move, you either type "move" or "go" into the command line, followed by
the desired direction (in terms of north, south, east, west). You can also just type in the direction you wish 
to go. If you have moved successfully, a description of the new room you are in will be printed out to the 
console.

TAKE
Items are an important aspect of Adventure. One way you can interact with them is by taking them. If you are in 
a room that has an item, you can enter "take", or "get", followed by the item name, to add that item to your
inventory. This will subsequently remove the object from the rooms inventory.

DROP
Along with taking items, you can also drop them. To drop an item from your inventory, simply type in the command
"drop", followed by the name of the item you wish to drop. This will add the item to the rooms inventory, and remove
it from your own.

OTHER
The last command available to you, the player, is "inventory". Inventory will return the names 
of all the items in your inventory, or tell you if it is empty. It is accessed by typing "inventory".
